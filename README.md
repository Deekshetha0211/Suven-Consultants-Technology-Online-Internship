_**Tool(s) Used - Python (Google Colab)**                                                                                                                                           

Coding for Performing Analysis of Meteorological Data Project of Data Analytics using Python Domain

The problem statement:

1. Transform the raw data into information and then convert it into knowledge.

2.  Monthly analysis has to be done for all 12 months over the 10 year period

3. Data can be found at :point_right: https://www.kaggle.com/muthuj7/weather-dataset/version/1

4. Perform data cleaning, perform analysis for testing the (given) Hypothesis

5. Support your analysis by appropriate visualizations using matplotlib and / or seaborn library.

## Task-2 Recognizing Handwritten Digits with scikit-learn

Using sci learn kit the visulaisation is observed :computer:

_**Tool(s) Used - Python (Google Colab)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
The problem statement and the predictions that are to be made:

1. Predict and do the handwriten digits recognition and visually represent it :bookmark:

2. Support your analysis by appropriate visualizations using matplotlib and / or seaborn library.
